The following is some documentation for the web server set up for use for the Lakehead University Computer Science Society. Some quick details to start off:

 - Current Url: [lucss.ca](http://lucss.ca)
 - Current IP: 159.203.58.212
 - Hosted By: DigitalOcean Droplet
 - Users with root access: Daniel Kivi
 - Users with developer access: 

The server is set up so anyone with developer access can read, write and execute from the /var/www folder. This is so people can pull in updates from several projects github repos and build/run those projects. The specific instructions for each project are specified in their own files in this repo. 

Any questions can be directed to myself, Daniel Kivi (@DanielKivi) through GitHub, Slack, or Email at danny@dannykivi.com
